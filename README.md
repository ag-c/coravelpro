# Coravel Pro

![schedule](./img/schedule-browser.png)

A professional admin panel for .NET Core apps!

Coravel Pro integrates seamlessly into your .NET Core app to give you a near-zero config admin backend. Ditch the database IDE and manage your important backend tasks and data with ease.

# Licensing

For non-commercial scenarios (side-projects, startups with no revenue, etc.) it's free to use - try it now!

Otherwise, if you are using Coravel Pro in a business or as a solo developer making revenue please [**purchase a license.**](https://www.pro.coravel.net/pricing.html)

Yes, it's not free. Why? 

It's not enough to open source it and "expect" donations. This isn't a hobby project. This is a legitimate product and is tough work.

This means (a) I will maintain it and (b) it will be production quality and (c) issues will be dealt with.

[Coravel](https://github.com/jamesmh/coravel) is open source and always will be.
